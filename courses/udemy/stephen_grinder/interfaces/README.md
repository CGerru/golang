# Interfaces

Interfaces are used to avoid writing extremely specialized code and improve reusability.

## Notes

- Interfaces are not generic types
- Interfaces are implicit, theres no need to specify what custom type satisfies. So here is no explicit implementation like Java
- Interfaces are a contract to help manage types. If a function is implemented but it is broken or does not performs as expected then this help is non existent.
- Interfaces are tough. Understanding how to read interfaces in the standard lib is the first step and all its difficulty curve requires practice and experience.
